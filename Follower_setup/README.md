# Bimanual Follower Arm Setup

This rig is built from an **aluminium-extrusion frame** that carries two [ARX-R5](https://arx-x.com/?product/22.html) *or* [Trossen WidowX-AI](https://www.trossenrobotics.com/widowx-ai) arms.  
The whole assembly can be repositioned quickly and locked in place with **quick-release clamps**.
